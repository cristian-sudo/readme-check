## PHP Tip
- Use `isset()` to check if a variable is set.  

**Quote of the Day:** "C++ certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it's a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee." — *Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz*
